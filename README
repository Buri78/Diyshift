Please note that Sram has released a new version of its X5 rear derailleur for 2012 which has not been tested for 
compatibility with the E-railleur kit. As a result the E-railleur kit CAD and image files will remain here
for reference purposes only. 

All .pde files are intended for use with the Arduino IDE  http://www.arduino.cc
All .fz files are viewable with Fritzing  http://fritzing.org
All .dxf may be viewed with Qcad community edition http://www.qcad.org or most other 2D CAD software

These files by no means represent a completed work but instead a snapshot of a work in progress. 
There are still many obstacles to be overcome and improvements to be made. I will provide 
continual updates as they become available. For more information regarding this project please visit
