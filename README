CAD, schematic and code files for the Diyshift electronic bicycle shifter project.

All .pde files are intended for use with the Arduino IDE  http://www.arduino.cc
All .fz files are viewable with Fritzing  http://fritzing.org
All .dxf may be viewed with Qcad community edition http://www.qcad.org or most other 2D CAD software

These files by no means represent a completed work but instead a snapshot of a work in progress. 
There are still many obstacles to be overcome and improvements to be made. I will provide 
continual updates as they become available. For more information regarding this project please visit
